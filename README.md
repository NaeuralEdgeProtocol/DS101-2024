# DS101-2024 Data Science with Deep Learning DS-101 (7th edition)
_From dataset understanding to result presentation and how to employ deep acyclic graph models in Predictive Analytics_

Welcome to 2024-2025 Data Science with Deep Learning
This is the 7th revision of the graduate course in Data Science - a 11 lecture & hands-on labs journey in the hot field that combines programming, math, statistics, bio/physics in order to provide the today world with the most advanced information technologies: from recommender systems to chatbots, from predictive analytics to visual scene understanding and many others.

## Operational and logistics stuff
 - we meet each Monday 16h00-20h00 on Teams!
 - Graded project - real-life problem: 70% (minimum 30% for grading)
 - Research paper (important) presentation individual: 30%
 - Secondary project (optional extra-credit): 15%
 - 2nd Research paper (optional research highlight pres.): 15%

## Repo structure
 - `"root"` all the slides
 - `mandatory_papers` all the available papers to chose from for mandatory research presentation
 - `scripts` scripts/notebooks from each interactive lecture 
 - `resources` important materials such as linear algebra, stats, etc
 - `data` folder with toy and maybe-not-so-toy datasets


 ## Course Project Rules
  - 1-3 students per project
  - end-to-end small application that will have the following components:
    - script or Jupyter notebook model definition and training - using scrapped / real life data and some basic model architecture searching techniques -> will generate a serving candidate model
    - simple straightforward model serving backend - using Flask or FastAPI
    - simple frontend - using Bokeh, React or Angular or anything else - for example just a simple HTML page with some data entry controls within a submittion form and a result section below the form

## Course Research Highlight tips
 - simple PPT/Slides/PDF presentation
 - focus on the parts of the paper that you found out to be the most interesting and you liked the most
 - value and quality over quantity
